**Responsabilities**:

cmd/nethegateapi/main.go starts the application/service

internal/openAPIHandlers : These are the handlers generated by OpenAPI. They route requests to the service (eg createNewUser, )

internal/nethGateAPI: This is the core of the service. It is responsible for handling the requests, for example generating a new API key for users, syncing this with Kong, and storing the users data in a local DB

internal/kongAdminAPI: we need this to sync our users data with Kong (ie integrate with Kong Admin API)

internal/juno: this is just to make RPC calls to Juno

internal/db: this is to store the user data in a local data base persistently


**Structure**:

internal/openAPIHandlers imports internal/nethGateAPI

internal/nethGateAPI imports internal/kongAdminAPI, internal/juno, internal/db
